Bubble Painter
===

Apple removed the ability to customize the colors of the message bubbles in [Messages.app](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messages_%28application%29#OS_X_version) in Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite. This app gives you back that ability.

**As of macOS 10.14 Mojave, I have not time to maintain this project, so it may not work well on recent versions of macOS. Pull requests to help with the maintenance welcome!**

How to install
===

First [download latest version](https://github.com/kethinov/BubblePainter/releases/latest) <a href='https://github.com/kethinov/BubblePainter/releases/latest'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kethinov/BubblePainter/master/dev/appicon.png' width='52' height='52'></a>

Then if you're running OS X 10.11 El Capitan or a later version of OS X, you will need to disable System Integrity Protection temporarily in order to use Bubble Painter.

Disable System Integrity Protection temporarily
---

On OS X 10.11 El Capitan or later versions of OS X, you must disable System Integrity Protection temporarily to use this app.

*Note: none of this is necessary on OS X 10.10 Yosemite. Only OS X 10.11 El Capitan or later versions of OS X.*

Here's how:

Restart your Mac and hold down <img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kethinov/BubblePainter/master/assets/cmdr.png' width='25%' height='25%' alt='âŒ˜ Command + R'> until the Apple logo appears on your screen.

You should now see this:

Now open the `Utilities` menu and select `Terminal`:

In the Terminal window that opens, enter the following command: `csrutil disable`

Then press the return key. Afterward you should see the following message:

Then restart your Mac and Bubble Painter should work.

**It is recommended that you reenable System Integrity Protection after you're done using Bubble Painter.**

To reenable System Integrity Protection, follow the same steps as above, but enter the following terminal command instead: `csrutil enable`

Then simply reboot again.

It's a [known issue](https://github.com/kethinov/BubblePainter/issues/29) that going through this much hassle sucks. If you have an idea for how to avoid all this being necessary, I'd love to hear it!
